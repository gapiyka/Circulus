In my quest to explore and assimilate the latest features of the Unity Engine, I have chosen to undertake the development of specific game mechanics as part of my test task for this job vacancy. Leveraging the innovative Unity Visual Scripting, I am eager to showcase my proficiency in harnessing this tool to bring dynamic and engaging gameplay elements to life
